		<h1>Parametric - swap for logo</h1>
		<h3>by</h3> 
		<h2>MAN XMACHUNE logo</h2>
		Parametric is an interactive digital artwork that investigates our individual and collective emotional state in a post isolated world to create unique pieces of art.

You are invited to input your feelings on a sliding scale across a series of questions about how you feel about your life and relationships. Each input changes the artwork and renders a morphing and shifting piece of art on the screen before your very eyes.
