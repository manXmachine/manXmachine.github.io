		<h1>Parametric</h1>
		Parametric is an interactive digital artwork that investigates our individual and collective emotional state in a post isolated world to create unique pieces of art.

You are invited to input your feelings on a sliding scale across a series of questions about how you feel about your life and relationships. Each input changes the artwork and renders a morphing and shifting piece of art on the screen before your very eyes.

When you’re ready to share into the “cloud”, your data will be merged with other people’s data, creating a dynamic piece of art that displays our collective feelings in real-time.
